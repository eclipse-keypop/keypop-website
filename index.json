In this case you will have to notify the issue in the repository where the problem appeared and reference the issue in all the other repositories affected by the fix. Propose the creation of a new component. In this case you will first have to create an issue in the repository https://github.com/eclipse-keypop to justify the need and request the creation of a new repository, wait for the issue to be resolved by the decision of the committers, and then create an issue in the new repository signifying the start of development of the new component. Eclipse Contributor Agreement Before your contribution can be accepted by the project team contributors must electronically sign the Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA).\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php Commits that are provided by non-committers must have a Signed-off-by field in the footer indicating that the author is aware of the terms by which the contribution has been provided to the project. The non-committer must additionally have an Eclipse Foundation account and must have a signed Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA) on file.\nFor more information, please see the Eclipse Committer Handbook: https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#contributing\nContributing via fork Check if there is already a GitHub issue for what you want to work on or create one. Announce in the comments section that you want to work on the issue. Also describe the solution you want to implement. To improve the chances for your contribution to be accepted, you’ll want to wait for the feedback of the committers. Fork the repository. Create a new branch from main for your changes. Name it after the issue number, e.g. #XXX_[description_of_changes]. Implement your changes. Rebase on main. Run ./gradlew spotlessApply to format the code and add licence headers to the files. Run ./gradlew build (to check code formatting and run tests) Commit your changes using the -s flag in order to add a Signed-off-by footer as mentioned above and use the same email address you are using for your GitHub account.\nUse commits messages that respect the commits message conventions. Push your changes to your forked repository. Submit a pull request referencing the related issue(s). After submitting, do not use your branch for any other development, otherwise further changes that you make will be visible in the PR. Contributing as a project committer Check if there is already a GitHub issue for what you want to work on or create one. Assign the issue to yourself. Create a new branch from main for your changes. Name it after the issue number, e.g. #XXX_[description_of_changes]. Implement your changes. Rebase on main. Run ./gradlew spotlessApply to format the code and add licence headers to the files. Run ./gradlew build (to check code formatting and run tests) Commit your changes. Use commits messages that respect the commits message conventions. Push the branch into the repository. Submit a pull request and ask somebody who is familiar with the code you modified to review it. If the reviewer approves and all checks are OK, merge using squash \u0026amp; commit method. Commits message conventions In order to ensure good readability of the commit history, it is necessary to have consistency in the structure of the commit messages.\nTherefore, all contributors to the project are asked to respect the structure of the commits messages as described in the guide Conventional Commits 1.0.0:\n\u0026lt;type\u0026gt;[optional scope]: \u0026lt;description\u0026gt; [optional body] \u0026lt;footer(s)\u0026gt; Furthermore, it is requested to indicate in the footer section the associated issue(s) that will be closed (Closes #xxx, closes #yyy, etc.). This will automatically close the associated issue(s) when the pull request is validated (see GitHub Docs for more details).\nIt is also required to indicate possible references to other associated issues (Refs: #aaa, #bbbb, repository_owner/other_repository_name#ccc, etc.).\nHere is fictive example:\nfeat(observation): allow asynchronous notification of reader events Add a public method in the observable reader to enable asynchronous notifications.

At the end of 2026, we plan to extend the Calypso APIs to support the integration of new security module solutions based on the Calypso ‘OpenSAM’ specification.
