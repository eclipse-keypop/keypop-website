**_"the best APIs for processing smart cards"_**
- Keypop offers **generic interfaces** to **operate smart card readers** and integrate dedicated **libraries to process smart card** solutions, facilitating the standardization of modular and interoperable software solutions providing high-level access to card readers and card transactions.
- An additional interface is included to manage the [Calypso® smart card](https://calypsonet.org/calypso-for-cards/) solution.

Two versions of Keypop APIs are available: in Java and in C++.
- These APIs follow the [smart card terminal interface models](https://terminal-api.calypsonet.org/) defined by the [Calypso Networks Association](https://calypsonet.org/). 
- The [Eclipse Keyple®](https://keyple.org/) open source project provides libraries implementing the Keypop APIs for the 'Reader' and 'Calypso' layers.
